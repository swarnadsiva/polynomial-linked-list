# Polynomials

In my object-oriented Java class, I was tasked with creating a linked list ADT
representation that handled one-variable polynomial expressions.

## Design

This implementation includes definition of a Polynomial interface that supports
adding and removing terms, getting the degree and coefficient of a specific power
of the polynomial, evaluating and adding polynomials together.
